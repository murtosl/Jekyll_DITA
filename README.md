2) rationalizes the decisions behind its information architecture.


## Grading rubric

* DITA project addresses a set 3 particular (writing) tasks/goals within the community of practice identified in the historicizing project.

* Demonstrates proper planning and iterative revisions to topic model, using appropriate directory structures and linking, as well as conditional processing techniques.

* Topic model demonstrates user audience awareness and their levels of expertise.

* DITA markup follows the guidelines provided in our book: Bellamy et al., pp. 36 (topics generally), 55-56 (tasks), 66 (conceptual), 77 (reference), 119 (mapping).

* DITA markup is clean with proper syntax and spacing.

* File naming and hierarchy is clean and logical.

# Notes to Self

Document design is a writing task, so explaining how to organize the HTML/CSS is appropriate.

Writing a post/page is a writing task (You don't say.)

It also says 'goals'. A goal would be to make your website written work visible. Configuration is a goal.

Mmm... is creating a website with Jekyll a writing goal, or do I just need to focus on like, cross-references? It's not doing any good if there's no site, so I say write the whole big process.

The fact of the matter is I would like to go above and beyond and use this project as a documentation writing sample for potential employers. But, I am working on three finals. Logie's is the hardest, Tech Com is only hard because it's group work and schedules are fun. This is decently straightforward, but I can't work on it on a lab computer because no command line access.

There is no way I have enough time to make a complete config file documentation right now. I'm just going to have to stick with what I've used. It's needed though.

You still need to fix NPP on your laptop.
